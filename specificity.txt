Question: If one element is styled by more than one rule, which style will be applicable???????

ex. 
    <div>
        <p class = "red-p"> 
            Text...
        </p>
    </div>

 CSS
    p{
        color : green;
    }

    .red-p{
        color : red;
    }

    div.red-p{
        color: blue;
    }


Answer: More specific rule will get more value

    General Rule:
        !important will override everything
        Inline can overwrite everything except !important
        External will work according to specificity
    
    Specificity Rule:
        (#) id selector has highest value.
        (*) Universe selector has lowest value
    
    Specificity Rule trick(Point system):

        10000 point to !important
        1000 to Inline
        100 to id
        10 to class, attribute and pseudo-class
        1 for element selector and pseudo-element
        0 to universal selector

        CSS
    1 point: p{
        color : green;
    }

    10 point: .red-p{
        color : red;
    }

    11 point: div.red-p{
        color: blue;
    }

    So, div.red-p will apply

    Note: if same rule is written two or more times in external sheet then last rule will be applicable.
